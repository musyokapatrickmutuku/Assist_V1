# 🏥 Assist AI - Bridging the Care Gap in Chronic Disease Management

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

**422 million people** worldwide live with diabetes. Each faces:
- 📅 **3-week average wait** for non-emergency consultations
- 😰 **78% experience anxiety** about unaddressed symptoms
- 📞 **Doctors receive 50+ routine calls daily**

**Assist AI** is a human-in-the-loop platform that enables doctors to provide timely, verified responses to patient queries through AI-assisted drafts.

## 🚀 Quick Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/musyokapatrickmutuku/Assist_V1.git
cd Assist_V1

# Quick setup (recommended)
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup:
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example backend_service/.env
# Edit .env and add your DeepSeek API key

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up

# Access the app
# Frontend: http://localhost:8501

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)
- DeepSeek API key

### Local Development
```bash
# Backend development
cd backend_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Frontend development  
cd frontend/streamlit_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required in backend_service/.env
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_API_BASE=https://api.novita.ai/v3/openai
DB_PATH=queries.db
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Considerations
- Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- Configure HTTPS with proper certificates
- Set up proper authentication and session management
- Implement HIPAA compliance measures
- Add monitoring and logging
